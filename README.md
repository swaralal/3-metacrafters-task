## Introduction

Solidity provides several loop structures and function declarations to help you write efficient and maintainable smart contracts. This repository aims to demonstrate the usage of loops and functions with practical examples.

## Loops

Loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times until a certain condition is met. Solidity supports the following loop types:

### For Loop

The `for` loop allows you to iterate a specific number of times. It consists of an initialization statement, a condition, and an increment statement.
